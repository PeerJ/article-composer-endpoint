Endpoint for article composer


Requirements:

* MongoDB

Optional: Python VirtualEnv

To Install:

Once mongo is installed (pretty easy with homebrew)

```
cd requirements
pip install -r mac.txt
cd ..
python app.py
```

This will start an app running on localhost:8888 where you can post data to.

In the database it stores the docs and post data.
